            <p>Richie Arkanoff is a Freshman at Purdue University pursuing a degree in User Experience Design. He is passionate about creating technology that serves the needs of users in an ever-changing landscape. He is an Eagle Scout and part of the National Youth Leadership Training program of the Boy Scouts of America, where he mentors and leads students through communication, teaching, and leadership skills. Connecting with his community through service projects and peer mentorship, Richie has gained a life-long passion for serving others. As a high school student, he gained an interest for design and the arts that matched his passion for technology and coding. Through this time, he gained an experience in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, leading his class through the creation of an identity and marketing campaign for his schoolâ€™s Arts Festival, which was cut short due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Taking classes in both computer science and graphic design in high school led to an eye opening experience discovering the field of user experience design, where his passion for people and behavior leads a field which emphasizes the use of devices in our everyday lives. He was drawn to the program because of its emphasis on shaping technology through collaborative strategy and design. In his free time, Richie can be found enjoying hiking, listening to podcasts, and exploring new apps. He can be contacted through email or other social mediums. rarkanof@purdue.edu ; www.linqapp.com/richardarkanoff </p>
            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2> 
            <p>As a designer, I believe in building products that are personable, inclusive and consistent. Technology must do all that we ask it to while becoming more and more personable and life-like, responding to us in ways we can expect from each other. This includes creating more realistic simulated experiences that can make the digital world blend in seamlessly. Inclusivity is more important than ever, and our designs should always reflect as many people as they can and hope to build a more inclusive future. Diverse perspectives continue to drive the important work being done today and it must expand in the future to adapt to the increasing amount of diverse perspective. Consistency is key to every design process, and ensuring that users can easy learn and adapt to processes that are clear and straightforward and continue to advance the adaptability of digital products.</p>
