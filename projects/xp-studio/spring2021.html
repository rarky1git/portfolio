            <h1 class="title">Technology For Humankind</h1>
            <h2>Project Scope</h2>
            <h3>Problem Space</h3>
            <p>Technology for Humankind tasked us with simplifying their setup process for their Friendship Lamps. These lamps connect to Wi-Fi and allow people to communicate to loved ones by simply tapping their lamp. When tapped, the paired lamp(s) light up with an assigned color, showing who is sent the gesture. The setup process can be frustrating for people with low technical literacy if network issues pop up, or if they arrive at a point in the setup process that is beyond their understanding or experience level. This frustration hinders Humankind’s goal of creating positive interactions between people if the experience of using the lamps begins with issues getting started.</p>
            <h3>User Group</h3>
            <p>The user group that we focused on was customers with low technical literacy, specifically, people who have limited experience setting up Wi-Fi Internet of Things devices. Humankind has found that this group often needs assistance setting up their devices, so they wanted us to have the setup process take their needs into account.</p>
            <h3>Deliverables</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Research, including a competitive analysis, secondary research, and user testing with the lamps. </li>
                <li>Low-fidelity prototypes for a mobile application setup process. These mobile app prototypes will be low-fidelity mockups of an application, meaning that they will show the content and look of the application but no interactivity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Current Set-up Process</h2>
            <p>There are currently three setup options for the Friendship Lamp: Bridge Setup, Automatic Setup (Windows 10 only), and Direct to Wifi Setup. Our team was tasked with improving the direct to wifi setup because it causes the most issues for customers according to our sponsor.</p>
            <h3>Direct to Wifi Setup Process Flowchart</h3>
            <a href="https://support.filimin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012931534#Automatic%20Setup%20(option%20for%20Windows%20users)">Filimin’s Setup Guide</a>

            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nWF_0rUiA6gdy4YUDF5he-xgGlaNVZDE/view">Link to flowchart image</a>
            <p>In order to understand the current set-up process we created a flowchart of the current steps the user would go through when using the direct to wifi setup option. We then used sticky notes to indicate possible errors (red) and improvements (blue). The flowchart was used to guide our ideation for the new app.</p>

            </table>
            <h2>Understanding our User Group</h2>
            <p>A literary analysis was conducted to learn more about different setup processes and identify issues with the current setup process for the Filimin Friendship Lamps. Two main topics researched were: other setup guides that are wifi-related to analyze their setup processes and ways to help people who have low technical literacy understand things that require technical literacy.</p>
            <p>Based on the findings, an affinity diagram – which is a way to organize research findings</p>
            <img src="img/user-group-diagram.png" alt="">
            <p>into categories – was created in order to organize different ways to help people with low technical literacy. The guiding questions for our secondary research were as follows: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to accommodate people with low technical literacy?</li>
                <li>How people can gain technical literacy, how to quickly inform people without overwhelming them?</li>
                <li>How to simplify the understanding of technical processes?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Insights from literary analysis that help people who have low technical literacy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using visuals and having clear and concise instructions are critical for people with low technical literacy</li>
                <li>Instructional videos that work through the process with the user</li>
                <li>Simplifying any jargon language helps accommodate people with low technical literacy. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The team assessed the current Filimin Friendship Lamp setup process and identified areas where the setup process could help people with low technical literacy. Two specific areas that could be improved are the unpackaging of the box to emphasize there are two ways to set up the lamp and clearer instruction when connecting to the lamp wifi and then reconnecting back to regular wifi.</p>
            <h2>Exploring Set-up Processes</h2>
            <p>A competitive analysis was conducted to see different setup processes Filimin’s competitors and other companies use to understand what aspects could help or hinder users with low technical literacy. The team researched the current Filimin set-up, two direct competitors, and then six additional set-up processes for different products. The additional device set-up processes were included to show how other devices lay out their set-up processes. The research was then synthesised to focus on the main features that create a more comprehensible set-up process helping to support future ideation.</p>

            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11x4ndtWJXT3-8RHiF8673G8TEITP7LMi/view">Link to competitive analysis image</a>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>The most beneficial features that aided users were those that included visuals (i.e. videos, pictures, icons) along with having detailed step-by-step instructions. The competitive analysis helped in brainstorming alterations to the current set-up process layout that would be the most beneficial for those with low technical literacy. These main takeaways influenced the initial sketches and will continue to be reflected on with further ideation.</p>
            <h2>Gaining Knowledge of First Hand Issues</h2>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>For our first round of primary research for this project, interviews were conducted with Customer Support Representatives from Technology for Humankind and customers of the Filimin Friendship Lamps to gain a better understanding of recurring issues with the setup process of the Friendship Lamps.</p>
            <h4>Customer Support Representatives – interview goals:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Gain an understanding of what issues the Customer Service Reps have to deal with</li>
                <li>Gain any information about their experiences while helping customers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Filmin customers  – interview goals:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Find out where they struggled with the Friendship Lamp setup process</li>
                <li>Better understand their level of technical literacy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>The interviews were used to give direction to what parts of the set-up process needed to be altered to better accommodate users who have limited experience with connecting Internet of Things devices.</p>
            <p>The questions for the customer service representatives focused on their experiences with helping customers over the phone and the common issues that were brought up while talking to these customers. The questions for the Filmin customers  focused on their experience setting up the Filimin Lamps and also focused on revealing points of confusion they experienced.</p>
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y-hu4Vy8fx2HXhIeMZItQHoGLXv2q0hR/view">Link to Interview affinity diagram image</a>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <h4>Common issues customers experience:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Connecting the lamps to wifi </li>
                <li>Issues with the bridge (an alternate setup that plugs directly into the wifi router):</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Malfunctioning</li>
                    <li>Not understanding the purpose of it</li>
                    <li>Thought it should be optional because they preferred the wifi-setup process</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Website confusion:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of explanation of what certain terms mean</li>
                    <li>Confusion about the color customization</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>Insights from Customer Service Representatives:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Intentionally use visuals</li>
                <li>Be personable and patient with customers</li>
                <li>Customers shared the wifi-setup was very easy when a customer service rep walked them through it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Making the options for the set up clear, simplifying the terms and words on the website, and changing the layout of the color customizations are all ideas to take away from the interviews. These insights were taken into sketching and prototyping, and the focus was on addressing some of these pain points.</p>
            <h2>Laying out the New Set-up Process</h2>
            <p>Now that the team had a deep understanding of the current setup process and the issues that users encountered, this led us to create a new flowchart for a set-up in which the problems and issues were addressed. The new flowchart helped to spark ideas and make sure the team was on the same page about the direction of the app.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3> 
            <p>The flow helped to create a plan on how we are going to correct the current set-up process. The flowchart organized these alterations needed to be made. These included visuals, icons, and simplified wording. After we created some sketches we used the flowchart to create paper prototypes for each step of the process to help us flesh out our set-up process.</p>
            <h2>Exploring Concepts & Ideas</h2>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>In order to explore ideas based on findings from our research, interviews, and competitive analysis, we did some sketching with the specific aim of making the setup process more accessible and easy to use for users with low technical literacy. Team members created individual sketches using takeaways from our interviews and preliminary secondary research, focusing on accommodating for low technical literacy.</p>
            <p>The main takeaways that we used as inspiration for our sketching were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Issues with connecting lamp to wifi</li>
                <li>Unclear instructions (especially relating to wifi connection steps)</li>
                <li>Confusion about color meanings & color selection</li>
                <li>High quality visuals and walkthrough videos are very helpful</li>
                <li>Simple language and clear concise steps are key</li>
            </ul>

                    This sketch shows a “needed info/materials” section at the beginning of the instructions so that users are prepared before starting the setup process. It also shows a detailed but simply broken down step by step walkthrough of the setup process to help users keep from being overwhelmed and know exactly what step they are on.

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Linked resources are a good way to accommodate for low technical literacy without cluttering the written steps or bothering people who do not need the extra resources</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>They strike a good balance between not enough information and too much information</li>
                </ul>
                <li>There needs to be a clear differentiation between the direct to wifi and bridge setup instructions</li>
                <li>The colors of the lamp and how to set them up should be clarified and simplified</li>
                <li>More visual aids, images, and videos can help more than written instruction</li>
                <li>Limit words – only include what is necessary </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>From this round of sketching, some key points that we found were keeping the instructions uncluttered while still providing extra resources, clarifying lamp color meanings and how to set them up, providing more visual aids, and keeping wording simple and short.</p>
            <p>Based on these key takeaways, we took the following focuses for our next round of sketching:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tailoring setup process to accommodate low technical literacy (how would that look?)</li>
                <li>Simplifying the setup process (what words and visuals should we use?)</li>
                <li>How could the current setup process look better on mobile?</li>
                <li>Redesign the color selection process and provide explanation colors. (How does this fit into the setup process?)</li>
            </ul> -->
            <h2>Refining Our Ideas</h2>
            <p>Our goal for this round of sketching was to narrow down and refine some of the key ideas we came up with from our initial sketches.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/refin-1.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    This sketch was done with the question “How could the current setup process look better on mobile?” in mind. It shows adding more visuals, indications for what step the user is on, and a help button on each page to assist users on mobile.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/refin-2.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    These sketches were based on the question “Redesign the color selection process and provide explanation colors, how does this fit into the setup process?” 
                </figcaption>
                <figcaption>
                    The top sketch shows the page for selecting lamp colors with two options for how to select: a color slider or choosing from swatches.
                </figcaption>
                <figcaption>
                    The second sketch shows how within a group, each member can see each other’s color swatch and edit them.
                </figcaption>

                <img src="img/refin-5.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    These sketches were based on the question “Simplifying the setup process (what words and visuals should we use?)” The sketches show clear visuals to aid user comprehension, clear, simple wording, and a link to settings to make it easier for users to go through a complex part of the wifi setup step. Each page that involves interaction with the physical device has an image or animation to help show the user what they should be looking for or what should be happening during that step.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/refin-6.png" alt="">
                <img src="img/refin-7.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    These sketches were focused on the question “Tailoring setup process to accommodate low technical literacy (how would that look?)”The right sketches show an idea to help users more easily connect their lamp to wifi by automatically pulling up pages for the user. It also features a “need help?” link so that users can easily clarify the step and get help.The left sketch at the bottom shows the page that would come up when “need help?” is clicked, with detailed instructions and resources explaining the step.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider having more “need help” links tailored to each step – this makes the information accessible without cluttering it for more experienced users</li>
                <li>Breaking the steps down page by page makes them more clear and understandable</li>
                <li>Need to simplify and explain the color selection</li>
                <li>Including more visuals and less words is key for increasing understanding of each step and how to complete it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on these takeaways as well as the takeaways from our first set of sketches, we began creating clearer and more defined sketches and paper prototypes that utilize these ideas. Our goal was to hone in on and visualize key features and changes that would assist low technical literacy users without getting in the way of users who have a better understanding of the technology.</p>
            <h2>Creating the First App Lay-out</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>Our team created paper prototypes in order to help visualize our ideations and user flow chart for the new application. We split up to create prototypes for each step of the process. The paper prototype created for each step was designed around specific questions, which are listed below each step.</p>
            <h3>Pages</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/first-app-1.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Questions: Are all the fields clear in what they ask for? Does this accommodate for someone who is technically illiterate?</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/firstapp-2.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Questions: Do these visuals provide good guidance during this step? Is the wording clear and concise? Would someone be able to complete this step?</figcaption>

            <figure>
                <img src="img/firstapp-3.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Questions: Do these visuals simplify their understanding of connecting their device to the Filimin wifi network? Does the wording translate across different devices? (android, apple, etc.)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/firstapp-4.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Questions: How can we show additional information when needed? How can we make it more clear which step the user is on?What do additional info pages look like? What content do they have? How to make it clear to disconnect from lamp wifi and reconnect to home/normal wifi? How do we show that reconnection may be automatic?</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/firstapp-5.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Questions: How can we include the grouping and coloring pages in the initial setup process? How do we best add people to groups without overwhelming them?</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>Evaluating Paper Prototypes</h2>
            <p>After creating our paper prototypes, we conducted a team evaluation of our designs. Our team divided into pairs that were responsible for creating one of the steps. This allowed us to evaluate the other steps with fresh eyes. The evaluation took place in Miro so the team could put sticky notes for their feedback.</p>
            <img src="img/evaluating-1.png" alt="">
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple wording made the directions under each step easier to follow.</li>
                <li>Use specific words to alleviate confusion between steps.</li>
                <li>Give explanations for steps to help the users understand the set-up.</li>
                <li>Have specific links for possible hiccups while set-up the device.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Improving the Setup Process Based on Evaluation</h2>
            <p>After completing paper prototype evaluations, we used those designs and evaluations to create digital wireframe mock-ups. These wireframes include specific words, phrases, icons, and visual hierarchy that we intend to evaluate through user testing. However, they did not include specific pictures or media in order to quickly create and evaluate these initial designs.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/improve-1.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    The “Connect to Device” section was significantly changed from our paper prototypes to our wireframes. Within our wireframes, we created links to help sections, which direct the user to a separate help page, emphasizing each topic of concern for users, such as “How do I find my wi-fi settings?”.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/improve-2.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    The “Connect to Device” section also included multiple states of each screen to define what different ways we could decrease the obfuscation of background tasks, like loading and connecting to the Filimin device, as is shown above.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>Adding Color Selection and Dashboard</h2>
            <p>After creating wireframes based on our paper prototype, we decided to create a color selection screen that’s included in the setup process as well as a dashboard that users are sent to after the setup process is finished. A color selector was created because users did not understand the purpose of selecting colors. A dashboard was created to help guide users on what features the dashboard has. Previously, the dashboard had no guidance and users did not utilize features like changing the lamp color or the amount of time their lamp can stay on because they did not know these features existed.  For color selection, we used sketches we made previously and for the dashboard we created sketches for ideation.</p>
            <h3>Sketches we Created for Color Selection</h3>

            <div>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>After that, the next room will show variations of the national park posters. In this room, we want our patrons to open their minds to new possibilities, visualize connections from the influence of old styles on today&#39;s artists, and see personal connections to design style.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>To do this, we will have a touchpoint where museum-goers can put their own words on a poster. The design artifacts and posters displayed will show different styles of the posters and witty or thought-provoking redesigns (for example, posters that feature bad yelp reviews or imagine what climate change would look like in the parks).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>Building off the reflections users may have had as well as the climate change posters, there will be a little walkway that introduces an environmentalist perspective on the designs. Following that will be an immersive experience which highlights climate change within the national parks, because we wanted to make connections to current events and embody what is happening today. This room will show green, flourishing natural life which slowly decays into a desolate wasteland as the user walks through this area.</p>

            <div>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>Following that room will be the exit tunnel where museum-goers can reflect on their experience. This will be the final touchpoint, where users can make an environmental pledge and it will become a leaf on a tree. Ultimately, we want the patrons to understand that just like Doug Leen and Brian Meebus restored the old posters, that same legacy can be carried on to restore the environment.</p>
            </div>
            <h1>Cultural Probes</h1>
            <p>When creating our cultural probes, we wanted to make them like a gift where people could explore the activities and have fun. Our goal was to capture the emotional experiences people had when visiting either Yellowstone, Smoky Mountain, or Acadia National Park.</p>
            <h2>Backpack Probe Tour</h2>
            <p>Below are the different activities we put in our cultural probe. The backpacks also included some simple instructions, while still trying to leave room for exploration and creativity. You can find the instructions and full-size photos returned from our probes in Appendix [x].</p>
            <h1>National Park Experiences Captured</h1>
            <p>Our team enjoyed reading the memories people shared from their National Park visit. We were able to pull out particular contexts from our participant&#39;s writing that had encapsulated their experience. We then used these participant experiences as inspiration moving forward for the types of responses we would want people to experience after visiting our museum exhibit.</p>
            <p>These are paraphrased key descriptors that we identified from the stories written on the back of postcards. Our biggest inspiration from these descriptors is to create a museum experience where someone leaves excited to share the exhibit with other people.</p>
            <h1>Final Touchpoints</h1>
            <h2>Screen Printing Process</h2>
            <p>The screen printing process is the first touchpoint that patrons will experience. After seeing and feeling posters in the previous room, patrons will get to choose a poster to recreate with a limited color palette. On the wall, written instructions are complemented with a video guide that walks them through the process. Sitting at a station, they can use color coded stencils to fill each section of the poster from the limited palette.</p>
            <img src="img/walk-3.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>Emotional Goals for Patron</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Inspired by the screen printing process</li>
                <li>A sense of completion from creating their own poster</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Digital Remixes</h2>
            <p>After recreating an original poster through the physical process, patrons interact with a digital experience that allows them to create their own remix of a famous poster. New posters can be made with words typed by patrons that add a personal touch to the experience. These personal posters can be sent to them by email to save on their phone or print at home. This is the last activity they will experience before a major shift of mood in the exhibit.</p>
            <img src="img/design-a-poster.png" alt="">
            <img src="img/design-a-poster-2.png" alt="">
            <h2>Environmental Pledge</h2>
            <p>Before exiting the exhibit, patrons have the opportunity to reflect upon or support environmental change through a pledge. Tablets along the wall encourage patrons to reflect on how they can support and preserve National Parks by being more environmentally friendly. Digital trees have leaves filled with conservation ideas from other patrons for inspiration, and submitting their own ideas allows them to see their ideas grow and come to life. Before leaving, patrons can explore the space and immerse themselves in actionable ideas that can help them contribute to the fight against climate change.</p>

            <p>Emotional Goals for Patron</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a fresh sense of the imminent effects of climate change</li>
                <li>a sense of responsibility to the parks</li>
                <li>curious about changes they could make in their daily life</li>
                <li>inspired by actionable ideas of conservation</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Exploring Touchpoints through Ideation</h1>
            <p>As a team, we set out to create some initial designs using the emotions and feelings we derived from the cultural probes and the immersive experiences we discovered at Newfields. Each part of the exhibit we ideated on is meant to further the understanding of the history of the National Park Posters as well as develop some kind of meaning or relationship between the patrons and the parks.</p>
            <h2>Immersive National Park Room</h2>
            <p>This room would provide a deeper understanding of why people had an appreciation for the parks, and why the posters are highly sought after as the parks have been resurrected by the American people. It was important to us that even the people who have not gotten to experience a National Park still get to feel the magic and wonder of being in one — something that our cultural probe participants expressed frequently throughout their responses..</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <h2>Interactive Walls</h2>
            <p>These interactive walls allow patrons to connect with multiple parks, by showing the components of each park that makes them unique. Patrons can also use these walls as a photo opportunity to share their experience with family or on social media.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <h2>Create Your Own National Park Poster</h2>
            <p>This touchpoint gives patrons the opportunity to get creative! Patrons would have access to the traditional limited color palette that was used when the National Park Posters were designed. One of the setbacks we quickly identified with this idea was that it may be intimidating or overwhelming to “non-artistic” patrons due to the lack of structure to the activity. This is something we took into consideration for our further iterations.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <h2>Reflective Touchpoint</h2>
            <p>The Parks will always remain a national treasure, but whether or not they will withstand our harmful environmental impact is less certain. The National Parks have given people memories, honeymoons, and exciting trips away from home. We want to show our patrons that it&#39;s time to give back to the earth.</p>
            <p>We wanted to find a way to feature some of the modern interpretations of the posters to show how the legacy of the posters is still carried on by artists today. (see below)</p>
            <img src="img/naturalist-original.png" alt="">
            <p>These posters were created by Hannah Rothstein and illustrate what she predicts the National Parks will look like in 2050 if we fail to act against climate change. Her art inspired us to create the following touch point. (next page)</p>

            <h1>Group Critique Feedback</h1>
            <p>During the course of our project, we had two group critiques that consisted of sharing our progress and receiving feedback on our overall narrative, our touchpoints, and any other concepts we shared.</p>
            <div class="quote-callout">
                <p>“I find it hard to stay engaged if there isn&#39;t enough interactivity”</p>
                <p>Peer during our Group Critique</p>
            </div>
            <p>This quote from our Group Critique really helped us reevaluate how we are building emotional and memorable connections between our exhibit, our touchpoints, and our patrons. In our further iterations, we really focused on the feelings we are trying to evoke and what we want our patrons to take away from the experience.</p>
            <h2>Solidifying a Narrative</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Missing the motivations in our narrative</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why was there a sudden desire to refurbish the posters?</li>
                    <li>Why are the posters still relevant today?</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2>Strengthening Our Touchpoints</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>“Create Your Own National Park Poster” touchpoint</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not everyone wants to sit down and create a masterpiece while they are going through a museum exhibit</li>
                    <li>Make it more accessible for those who are artistically “challenged”</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Make sure the physical space connects to the posters themselves</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The interactive walls are aesthetically pleasing, but how do they fit into the story we are trying to tell?</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2>Cultivating Experiences</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Museum Entrance (destroyed posters)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the first thing they see more shocking. Hundreds of destroyed posters is more impactful than just a few scattered throughout the main entrance.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Museum Exit</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encourage visitors to reflect on the environmental perspective of the parks. Give them something to think about as they walk out of the museum.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h1>Touch Point Ideation and Iterations</h1>
            <h2>Silkscreening Touchpoint (New)</h2>
            <p>As we continued to learn about our problem space, we discovered that the silkscreening method introduced by the artists who designed the posters was a large contributor to the future of how we mass produced products.</p>
            <p>The silk screening method that was used to create the posters is a unique part of the design of the National Park Posters. We wanted to give our patrons the opportunity to engage with a simple and fun version of this art style that can be done by children, adults, and families.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <img src="" alt="">
            <h2>Reflective Touchpoint (Iteration)</h2>
            <h3>Inspired by our initial Reflective Touchpoint and Immersive National Park Room</h3>
            <p>From our group critique, we realized that if we really wanted people to be thinking about the last touch point of the exhibit on the way out, it had to be as memorable as the entrance.</p>
            <p>Instead of having the environmental pledge stand in between a “before” and “after” climate change poster, we decided to create an immersive experience where patrons would walk into a National Park poster, but as they walk through it, nature starts to fade away and the destruction humans have caused starts to take over.</p>
            <img src="img/minecraft-1.png" alt="">
            <img src="img/minecraft-2.png" alt="">
            <p>This would lead into the environmental pledge section, where patrons can make a pledge and watch the trees grow leaves as each pledge is submitted. This represents the regrowth that we can accomplish by taking small but meaningful steps to combating climate change.</p>
            <h2>Design a National Park Poster (Iteration)</h2>
            <p>Taking the feedback we got from the Desk Critiques into account relating to artistic ability making it hard to design a modern poster from scratch, we decided to make this touch point completely digital.</p>
            <p>This touchpoint allows our patrons to partake in the creativity that the National Parks Posters have inspired in today&#39;s artists. They will have access to a full color palette, a few common fonts used across National Parks Posters as well as some modern ones, as well as some inspiration surrounding them for some alternative takes on the posters. After designing a poster, you can email it to yourself to keep forever, without wasting any paper!</p>

            <h1>Our Museum through the Lens of Visitors</h1>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>The graphics above show the experience of a parent and an 8 year old child visiting our exhibit to identify the different potential felt experiences and the learned experiences for children versus adults visiting our museum.</p>
            <h4>Major Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A child may lose interest more quickly in the less interactive portions of our exhibit such as the poster gallery</li>
                <li>A person should be able to skip some parts of the exhibit and still know what is happening; all of our rooms are National Park poster-focused</li>
                <li>The child will may not think as deeply about the exhibit as the parent, but would still enjoy the immersive aspects and newness of the different exhibit spaces</li>
                <li>The parent could be restless during the silkscreen portion or towards the end</li> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Could combat this with comfortable seating, warmer non-harsh lighting, etc.</li>
                    <li>The end tunnel is peaceful which could end the exhibit on a relaxing note</li>
                </ul>          
            </ul>
            <h1>Final Museum Takeaway</h1>
            <img src="img/ranger-doug.png" alt="">
            <p>The biggest takeaway we want people to leave our exhibit with is to feel empowered to follow in Ranger Doug Leen&#39;s footsteps. Just like Doug restored the destroyed WPA National Park Posters, we want people to feel empowered to help restore the environment and keep the National Parks alive. After all, these design artifacts wouldn&#39;t exist without the National Parks. </p>
            <h1>Team Reflection</h1>
            <img src="img/reflection-img.png" alt="">
            <p>Back in October when our team toured the Newfields Art Museum in Indy, we just brushed the surface of the limitless interactive touchpoint possibilities. We soon found ourselves with piles and piles of ideas and loads of excitement. This project allowed our team to learn about the in depth story behind the WPA National Park posters and walk people through that story in an engaging way. Our team&#39;s desire to advocate for the National Parks and environment came through the environmental activist stance we hope people leave the exhibit with. Overall, we learned a lot through prototyping, experience mapping, class group crits, sketching, and collaborative whiteboarding, and we are filled with satisfaction of how this museum exhibit turned out!</p>
