                <h2>Project Space</h2>
                <p>Technology for Humankind tasked us with simplifying their setup process for their Friendship Lamps. These lamps connect to Wi-Fi and allow people to communicate to loved ones by simply tapping their lamp. When tapped, the paired lamp(s) light up with an assigned color, showing who is sent the gesture. The setup process can be frustrating for people with low technical literacy if network issues pop up, or if they arrive at a point in the setup process that is beyond their understanding or experience level. This frustration hinders Humankind’s goal of creating positive interactions between people if the experience of using the lamps begins with issues getting started.</p>
                <h3>User Group</h3>
                <p>The user group that we focused on was customers with low technical literacy, specifically, people who have limited experience setting up Wi-Fi Internet of Things devices. Humankind has found that this group often needs assistance setting up their devices, so they wanted us to have the setup process take their needs into account.</p>
                <h3>Deliverables</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research, including a competitive analysis, secondary research, and user testing with the lamps. </li>
                    <li>Low-fidelity prototypes for a mobile application setup process. These mobile app prototypes will be low-fidelity mockups of an application, meaning that they will show the content and look of the application but no interactivity.</li>

            <h2>Current Set-up Process</h2>
            <p>There are currently three setup options for the Friendship Lamp: Bridge Setup, Automatic Setup (Windows 10 only), and Direct to Wifi Setup. Our team was tasked with improving the direct to wifi setup because it causes the most issues for customers according to our sponsor.</p>
            <h3>Direct to Wifi Setup Process Flowchart</h3>
            <a href="https://support.filimin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012931534#Automatic%20Setup%20(option%20for%20Windows%20users)">Filimin’s Setup Guide</a>

            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nWF_0rUiA6gdy4YUDF5he-xgGlaNVZDE/view">Link to flowchart image</a>
            <p>In order to understand the current set-up process we created a flowchart of the current steps the user would go through when using the direct to wifi setup option. We then used sticky notes to indicate possible errors (red) and improvements (blue). The flowchart was used to guide our ideation for the new app.</p>

            </table>
            <h2>Understanding our User Group</h2>
            <p>A literary analysis was conducted to learn more about different setup processes and identify issues with the current setup process for the Filimin Friendship Lamps. Two main topics researched were: other setup guides that are wifi-related to analyze their setup processes and ways to help people who have low technical literacy understand things that require technical literacy.</p>
            <p>Based on the findings, an affinity diagram – which is a way to organize research findings</p>
            <img src="img/user-group-diagram.png" alt="">
            <p>into categories – was created in order to organize different ways to help people with low technical literacy. The guiding questions for our secondary research were as follows: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to accommodate people with low technical literacy?</li>
                <li>How people can gain technical literacy, how to quickly inform people without overwhelming them?</li>
                <li>How to simplify the understanding of technical processes?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Insights from literary analysis that help people who have low technical literacy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using visuals and having clear and concise instructions are critical for people with low technical literacy</li>
                <li>Instructional videos that work through the process with the user</li>
                <li>Simplifying any jargon language helps accommodate people with low technical literacy. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The team assessed the current Filimin Friendship Lamp setup process and identified areas where the setup process could help people with low technical literacy. Two specific areas that could be improved are the unpackaging of the box to emphasize there are two ways to set up the lamp and clearer instruction when connecting to the lamp wifi and then reconnecting back to regular wifi.</p>
            <h2>Exploring Set-up Processes</h2>
            <p>A competitive analysis was conducted to see different setup processes Filimin’s competitors and other companies use to understand what aspects could help or hinder users with low technical literacy. The team researched the current Filimin set-up, two direct competitors, and then six additional set-up processes for different products. The additional device set-up processes were included to show how other devices lay out their set-up processes. The research was then synthesised to focus on the main features that create a more comprehensible set-up process helping to support future ideation.</p>

            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11x4ndtWJXT3-8RHiF8673G8TEITP7LMi/view">Link to competitive analysis image</a>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>The most beneficial features that aided users were those that included visuals (i.e. videos, pictures, icons) along with having detailed step-by-step instructions. The competitive analysis helped in brainstorming alterations to the current set-up process layout that would be the most beneficial for those with low technical literacy. These main takeaways influenced the initial sketches and will continue to be reflected on with further ideation.</p>
            <h2>Gaining Knowledge of First Hand Issues</h2>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>For our first round of primary research for this project, interviews were conducted with Customer Support Representatives from Technology for Humankind and customers of the Filimin Friendship Lamps to gain a better understanding of recurring issues with the setup process of the Friendship Lamps.</p>
            <h4>Customer Support Representatives – interview goals:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Gain an understanding of what issues the Customer Service Reps have to deal with</li>
                <li>Gain any information about their experiences while helping customers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Filmin customers  – interview goals:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Find out where they struggled with the Friendship Lamp setup process</li>
                <li>Better understand their level of technical literacy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>The interviews were used to give direction to what parts of the set-up process needed to be altered to better accommodate users who have limited experience with connecting Internet of Things devices.</p>
            <p>The questions for the customer service representatives focused on their experiences with helping customers over the phone and the common issues that were brought up while talking to these customers. The questions for the Filmin customers  focused on their experience setting up the Filimin Lamps and also focused on revealing points of confusion they experienced.</p>
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y-hu4Vy8fx2HXhIeMZItQHoGLXv2q0hR/view">Link to Interview affinity diagram image</a>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <h4>Common issues customers experience:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Connecting the lamps to wifi </li>
                <li>Issues with the bridge (an alternate setup that plugs directly into the wifi router):</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Malfunctioning</li>
                    <li>Not understanding the purpose of it</li>
                    <li>Thought it should be optional because they preferred the wifi-setup process</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Website confusion:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of explanation of what certain terms mean</li>
                    <li>Confusion about the color customization</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>Insights from Customer Service Representatives:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Intentionally use visuals</li>
                <li>Be personable and patient with customers</li>
                <li>Customers shared the wifi-setup was very easy when a customer service rep walked them through it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Making the options for the set up clear, simplifying the terms and words on the website, and changing the layout of the color customizations are all ideas to take away from the interviews. These insights were taken into sketching and prototyping, and the focus was on addressing some of these pain points.</p>
            <h2>Laying out the New Set-up Process</h2>
            <p>Now that the team had a deep understanding of the current setup process and the issues that users encountered, this led us to create a new flowchart for a set-up in which the problems and issues were addressed. The new flowchart helped to spark ideas and make sure the team was on the same page about the direction of the app.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3> 
            <p>The flow helped to create a plan on how we are going to correct the current set-up process. The flowchart organized these alterations needed to be made. These included visuals, icons, and simplified wording. After we created some sketches we used the flowchart to create paper prototypes for each step of the process to help us flesh out our set-up process.</p>
            <h2>Exploring Concepts & Ideas</h2>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>In order to explore ideas based on findings from our research, interviews, and competitive analysis, we did some sketching with the specific aim of making the setup process more accessible and easy to use for users with low technical literacy. Team members created individual sketches using takeaways from our interviews and preliminary secondary research, focusing on accommodating for low technical literacy.</p>
            <p>The main takeaways that we used as inspiration for our sketching were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Issues with connecting lamp to wifi</li>
                <li>Unclear instructions (especially relating to wifi connection steps)</li>
                <li>Confusion about color meanings & color selection</li>
                <li>High quality visuals and walkthrough videos are very helpful</li>
                <li>Simple language and clear concise steps are key</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Linked resources are a good way to accommodate for low technical literacy without cluttering the written steps or bothering people who do not need the extra resources</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>They strike a good balance between not enough information and too much information</li>
                </ul>
                <li>There needs to be a clear differentiation between the direct to wifi and bridge setup instructions</li>
                <li>The colors of the lamp and how to set them up should be clarified and simplified</li>
                <li>More visual aids, images, and videos can help more than written instruction</li>
                <li>Limit words – only include what is necessary </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>From this round of sketching, some key points that we found were keeping the instructions uncluttered while still providing extra resources, clarifying lamp color meanings and how to set them up, providing more visual aids, and keeping wording simple and short.</p>
            <p>Based on these key takeaways, we took the following focuses for our next round of sketching:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tailoring setup process to accommodate low technical literacy (how would that look?)</li>
                <li>Simplifying the setup process (what words and visuals should we use?)</li>
                <li>How could the current setup process look better on mobile?</li>
                <li>Redesign the color selection process and provide explanation colors. (How does this fit into the setup process?)</li>
            </ul> -->
            <h2>Refining Our Ideas</h2>
            <p>Our goal for this round of sketching was to narrow down and refine some of the key ideas we came up with from our initial sketches.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/refin-1.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    This sketch was done with the question “How could the current setup process look better on mobile?” in mind. It shows adding more visuals, indications for what step the user is on, and a help button on each page to assist users on mobile.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/refin-2.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    These sketches were based on the question “Redesign the color selection process and provide explanation colors, how does this fit into the setup process?” 
                </figcaption>
                <figcaption>
                    The top sketch shows the page for selecting lamp colors with two options for how to select: a color slider or choosing from swatches.
                </figcaption>
                <figcaption>
                    The second sketch shows how within a group, each member can see each other’s color swatch and edit them.
                </figcaption>

                <img src="img/refin-5.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    These sketches were based on the question “Simplifying the setup process (what words and visuals should we use?)” The sketches show clear visuals to aid user comprehension, clear, simple wording, and a link to settings to make it easier for users to go through a complex part of the wifi setup step. Each page that involves interaction with the physical device has an image or animation to help show the user what they should be looking for or what should be happening during that step.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>

                <img src="img/refin-7.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    These sketches were focused on the question “Tailoring setup process to accommodate low technical literacy (how would that look?)”The right sketches show an idea to help users more easily connect their lamp to wifi by automatically pulling up pages for the user. It also features a “need help?” link so that users can easily clarify the step and get help.The left sketch at the bottom shows the page that would come up when “need help?” is clicked, with detailed instructions and resources explaining the step.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider having more “need help” links tailored to each step – this makes the information accessible without cluttering it for more experienced users</li>
                <li>Breaking the steps down page by page makes them more clear and understandable</li>
                <li>Need to simplify and explain the color selection</li>
                <li>Including more visuals and less words is key for increasing understanding of each step and how to complete it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on these takeaways as well as the takeaways from our first set of sketches, we began creating clearer and more defined sketches and paper prototypes that utilize these ideas. Our goal was to hone in on and visualize key features and changes that would assist low technical literacy users without getting in the way of users who have a better understanding of the technology.</p>
            <h2>Creating the First App Lay-out</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>Our team created paper prototypes in order to help visualize our ideations and user flow chart for the new application. We split up to create prototypes for each step of the process. The paper prototype created for each step was designed around specific questions, which are listed below each step.</p>
            <h3>Pages</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/first-app-1.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Questions: Are all the fields clear in what they ask for? Does this accommodate for someone who is technically illiterate?</figcaption>

                <img src="img/firstapp-2.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Questions: Do these visuals provide good guidance during this step? Is the wording clear and concise? Would someone be able to complete this step?</figcaption>

            <figure>
                <img src="img/firstapp-4.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Questions: How can we show additional information when needed? How can we make it more clear which step the user is on?What do additional info pages look like? What content do they have? How to make it clear to disconnect from lamp wifi and reconnect to home/normal wifi? How do we show that reconnection may be automatic?</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/firstapp-5.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Questions: How can we include the grouping and coloring pages in the initial setup process? How do we best add people to groups without overwhelming them?</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>Evaluating Paper Prototypes</h2>
            <p>After creating our paper prototypes, we conducted a team evaluation of our designs. Our team divided into pairs that were responsible for creating one of the steps. This allowed us to evaluate the other steps with fresh eyes. The evaluation took place in Miro so the team could put sticky notes for their feedback.</p>
            <img src="img/evaluating-1.png" alt="">
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple wording made the directions under each step easier to follow.</li>
                <li>Use specific words to alleviate confusion between steps.</li>
                <li>Give explanations for steps to help the users understand the set-up.</li>
                <li>Have specific links for possible hiccups while set-up the device.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Improving the Setup Process Based on Evaluation</h2>
            <p>After completing paper prototype evaluations, we used those designs and evaluations to create digital wireframe mock-ups. These wireframes include specific words, phrases, icons, and visual hierarchy that we intend to evaluate through user testing. However, they did not include specific pictures or media in order to quickly create and evaluate these initial designs.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/improve-1.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    The “Connect to Device” section was significantly changed from our paper prototypes to our wireframes. Within our wireframes, we created links to help sections, which direct the user to a separate help page, emphasizing each topic of concern for users, such as “How do I find my wi-fi settings?”.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/improve-2.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    The “Connect to Device” section also included multiple states of each screen to define what different ways we could decrease the obfuscation of background tasks, like loading and connecting to the Filimin device, as is shown above.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>Adding Color Selection and Dashboard</h2>
            <p>After creating wireframes based on our paper prototype, we decided to create a color selection screen that’s included in the setup process as well as a dashboard that users are sent to after the setup process is finished. A color selector was created because users did not understand the purpose of selecting colors. A dashboard was created to help guide users on what features the dashboard has. Previously, the dashboard had no guidance and users did not utilize features like changing the lamp color or the amount of time their lamp can stay on because they did not know these features existed.  For color selection, we used sketches we made previously and for the dashboard we created sketches for ideation.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating the User’s Understanding </h2>
            <h3>Teach Back Testing</h3>
            <p>We conducted teach back testing on three individuals to see if our version of the setup process is beneficial for our users, and if the images included in the wireframes provided helpful guidance. The overall process of setting up Friendship Lamps was explained to the users. The users were instructed to go page by page to engage with the wireframes in order to complete tasks. We learned from the user what they expected from each page and if they understood the features of it. This will help us identify if the changes that we made to the setup process were useful, as well as guide any changes we make going forward. </p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Some of the main takeaways we received from testing were as follows. These helped inform the iterations you will see in the next section. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Groups</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Misunderstood what groups are</li>
                    <li>Didn’t understand that the buttons were supposed to toggle </li>
                    <li>Thought groups were to find new people interested in the same thing</li>
                    <li>Knew that groups connected lamps, but not that it was to connect w family</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Could add key phrases/ takeaways</li>
                <li>Couldn’t easily think of a lamp name</li>
                <li>Suggested to explain what everything was before the setup process</li>
                <li>Device ID was unclear (need a better picture)</li>
                <li>Wording of disconnecting from Filimin wifi was confusing, didn’t understand the purpose of connecting and disconnecting from wifi</li>
                <li>Did not understand that the white circle can be moved for the color customizer </li>
                <li>Going forward iterations need to take in account users who struggled while navigating the setup process</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Exploring Potentials Issues in the Set-up Process</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>After a feedback session with our professors, we decided to look into the possible edge cases that our users might encounter when using our designed app. We define edge cases as issues that occur infrequently or to a small number of users, but still need to be accounted for in our designs. The purpose of designing for these edge cases is to help users with low technical literacy recover from issues on their own, without needing to contact customer support.</p>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>In order to go more in depth on each section of the app, we split up into teams focusing on each step of the setup process.  We went through each of our assigned pages and identified what could go wrong for the user at each moment in the app. We then addressed these issues by iterating on the current mockup.</p>
            <h3>Possible Edge Cases</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Connecting to device</th>
                    <td>Device doesn’t automatically connect to lamp</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Home Wifi Setup</th>
                    <td>User doesn’t know WiFi name <br>

            <h3>Changed Mockups</h3>
            <p>After identifying what edge cases could occur at each step in the app, we made iterations to our mockups to address these issues.</p>
            <h3>Connecting to Device</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-1.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    This step happens very early, and occurs only if the lamp can’t automatically connect to the user’s personal device. There will be animations or images showing a phone moving closer to the Filimin lamp, so the user can easily understand what is meant.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Home Wi-fi Setup</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-2.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    We added a pop-up giving instructions for the user to “move closer to [their] Wi-Fi router” in case they are stationed too far away for the lamp to connect.  They also have the option to receive more help via the “More Help” button that will contact customer service.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-3.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    We added the option for  the user to input the network manually if the user’s home wifi network was unable to be picked-up by the lamp. There is also the  option for the user to get more help through a “More Help” button as well as contacting customer service via phone.                 </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Connect to Group</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-4.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    We added more explanation to the Groups page. We made sure the purpose of the lamps is properly stated so users can navigate through this part of the set up.                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-5.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    We were informed that if a lamp has been bought in a pair it will automatically be part of a group. On this screen users can see if the lamp  paired with theirs has been set up or not. Users also now have the option to add others into the preset group.                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Color Selection Page</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-6.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    The color selection number was removed, as it wasn’t clear how the number related what color the person wanted to choose.
                    We also changed the look of the tabs to make it more clear that there was a choice.                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-7.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    More text was added to explain the purpose of this page, as well as how the color range selection works. (We later got feedback that this was too text heavy, and instructions are reduced in later mockups).                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Dashboard</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-8.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    A dashboard tour was added to give users a walkthrough of the dashboard navigation.  The tour is an optional feature for first-time Friendship Lamp customers.                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-9.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    Callout boxes will appear throughout the tour pointing to specific features and stating its purpose and/or function (In later feedback we chose to highlight the area the callout is pointing to which can be seen in future iterations)                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-10.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    If a user accidentally selects the “remove member” or “leave group” option in the Group Settings, they will be shown a confirmation pop-up in which they will have to confirm or deny their selection.                 </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/edge-11.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    We later realized that we didn’t add in the option to confirm the selection. That is addressed in our final prototype.                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>This was the last point of creation that our group worked on before creating our final experience. Addressing these edge cases was important to do as these are easy to overlook, and attention to these areas can help our user group avoid being confused on what needs to be done next in the setup process.</p>
            <h2>Evaluating our Edge Cases</h2>
            <h3>Scenario Testing</h3>
            <p>Scenario testing involves creating hypothetical situations for the user to engage with our prototypes. We used our edge cases to create the scenarios to determine whether or not our iterations helped with those troubleshooting errors. We tested three people in our user group by showing them the screens, reading the scenario to them, and letting them determine what steps they would take to complete the task. We followed each completed task up with questions regarding their thought process and intentions. We also presented this testing to a customer support rep at Filimin to evaluate whether our iterations were helpful regarding the problems customers typically face.</p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>These are the takeaways from the customer support rep at Filimin:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We also have options for support contact via email and chat</li>
                <li>Once the user inputs their wifi information, the user’s phone disconnects from the lamp, and the setup process has to restart if the info is wrong</li>
                <li>It is rare for people to not have their network show up from the dropdown</li>
                <li>Having a step to check if the lamp is online is important</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are the takeaways from the users we tested with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users felt confused about what the wifi was and why it should have connected automatically.</li>
                <li>Users were initially confused about the amount of small text on the groups page.</li>
                <li>Users were confused by the options on the color selection page thinking that range of colors referred to both of the color sliders rather than just the circular range of color sliders.</li>
                <li>Users initially had a hard time seeing certain buttons and help links.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Iterations to our prototype</h3>
            <p>Using feedback received from scenario testing, we made iterations on our prototype as shown below:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/pro-1.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    On step two of the setup, we added a screen for verifying device settings after adding wifi info. This is where the app sends the wifi info to the lamp and verifies that the lamp is connected to the internet. This is a necessary step of the process.                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/pro-2.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    If the device settings are successfully verified, then this screen will show. This is to let the user know that the wifi connection was successful and they can move on to the next step of the process.                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/pro-3.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    On the color select screen we reduced the amount of text shown by adding an info icon that shows an overlay with information on how the color range works if users do not understand it.                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/pro-4.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    This is the overlay that users see from clicking the info icon on the color screen.                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>Analyzing our Design Through Heuristics </h2>
            <h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
            <p>Our overall goals for this method were to ensure that our design met usability and accessibility standards and would be optimized for use by our user group, who come from older demographics and have unique needs that need to be considered especially with readability of text and manual dexterity. We used a heuristic analysis, also referred to as a heuristic evaluation, in order to evaluate our design and ensure that it meets usability standards and the heuristics for older individuals. </p>
            <p>“Heuristic evaluation involves having a small set of evaluators examine the interface and judge its compliance with recognized usability principles (the “heuristics”)” (Chisnell et al., 2006). The main goal of a heuristic analysis is to discover usability problems in order to address them and make the interface easier for users to interact with. For the heuristic analysis we used a selection of heuristics developed for older adults, which addressed the needs of our user group who are mostly from an older demographic. These heuristics include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Readability (text size, placement)</li>
                <li>Interactive elements (buttons, dropdowns, menus)</li>
                <li>Interface text (text color, size, meeting AA / AAA standards)</li>
                <li>Error messages (placement, clarity, colors, wording)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Readability & Interface text</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/read-1.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    Using the existing Filimin Blue (#005691) with white text (#FFFFFF), this well exceeds AA and AAA accessibility standards, reaching a contrast ratio of 7.66:1.                 </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/read-2.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    In previous prototypes, a lighter blue (#3E8EC3) was used for link text including help links during the setup process. However, this text was changed to Filimin Blue to meet AA and AAA standards.                
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/read-3.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>
                    When using placeholder text, a light gray (was used previously in prototypes but did not meet AA or AAA standards. This text was then changed to a darker version of the light gray (#545454).                
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Based on this analysis, we set a standard font size, font weight, and color for different elements of our prototypes:</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The overall readability was poor because our text sizes were too small for older generations.</li>
                <li>Interactive elements: buttons, menus, and button cushion were lacking. We fixed this by including more button cushion and making buttons larger an easier to click</li>
                <li>Interface text was hard to read due to the size and color. We fixed this by bolding certain words to make the readability easier.</li>
                <li>Error Messages were placed in purposeful locations and had simple explanatory messages to help guide people on what to do if something was not working properly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Final Design Concept</h2>
            <p>Below are the main screens of our final design. We will discuss these screens in more detail further on in this documentation.</p>
