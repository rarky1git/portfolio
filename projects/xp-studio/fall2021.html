                    <h2>Company Overview</h2>
                    <p>Avanade is a global professional services company providing IT consulting and services focused on the Microsoft platform with artificial intelligence, business analytics, cloud, application services, digital transformation, modern workplace, security services, technology and managed services offerings.</p>    
                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <h3>Problem Space</h3>
                    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the service industry has been negatively impacted. Through research, we are seeking to navigate future alternatives in a future state of the service industry. An example of a future state would be a hotel moving customer service from human resources to digital panels. To clarify, the service industry itself is broad and consists of various different industries and was intentionally kept vague by our sponsors so we as a team could research various sector’s issues during the pandemic and eventually narrow to a specific sector. </p>

                    <h3>User Group</h3>
                    <p>We are focusing on professors in the Pharmaceutical department at Purdue seeking help navigating a hybrid or online classroom in a lab setting. Overall, education as an industry was heavily affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and this was the service industry sector our team focused on. After doing some brief initial literature review, we noticed a trend in which there were far more solutions and research done to help students succeed during the pandemic and far less research done on how to help professors teach in this current state of the world. Knowing this, we narrowed down on the kind of educational setting a professor could teach in. </p>
                    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
                    <p>Concept design package consisting of 3 stages of the future state of the Purdue Pharmaceutical Program regarding professors and teaching practices. These concepts would be very imaginative but also hopefully attainable for each respective stage, those being: Stage 1 [one year in the future], Stage 2 [five years in the future], Stage 3 [a full decade in the future].</p>
                    <p>Research, including a summary of our secondary and primary research, a touchpoint inventory, and evaluations on our final concepts.</p>

            <h2>Overview of Our Concept Design Package</h2>
            <p>Our team did in-depth research to figure out some of the pain points our user group was facing in the current state of the industry. With that, we ideated on these pain points and tried to figure out ways to alleviate some of the issues. </p>
            <p>In this documentation, we will be focusing on a few key features instead of all for better clarity and to provide an example of how our concepts could develop within the next ten years. To see a more extensive look into all of the ideas, we chose to expand on it in our concept design package. Here, we focused on the features in bold.</p>

            <h2>Overall Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Understanding How Education Adapted to COVID-19</h3>
            <p>The team needed a better understanding of how education adapted to alternate environments during the pandemic. Through this, we also needed a more specific space to start designing in.</p>
            <h4>Methods:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Touchpoint Inventory Workshop: Understand pathways and potential pain points.</li>
                <li>Literature Review: Obtain a better understanding of issues in our problem space.</li>
                <li>User Interviews: See how professors and students adapted to the pandemic.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Discovering The Virtual Cleanroom and Mapping Pain Points</h3>
            <p>After learning about virtual simulation labs, we wanted to go more in depth with a specific simulation lab. We wanted to understand what a virtual cleanroom is and how we could improve it for professors.</p>
            <h4>Methods:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Stakeholder Interview: Talk with the founder of a virtual cleanroom to understand what it is and how it is used by professors.</li>
                <li>User Journey Map: Map out the stages, user actions, touchpoints, and pain points of a professor’s experience in the virtual cleanroom.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Generating Concepts for The Virtual Cleanroom</h3>
            <p>Now that we had an understanding of our problem space and professor pain points, we wanted to begin generating concepts. Our goal was to use these concepts to put together our 10-year plan for the virtual cleanroom.</p>
            <h4>Methods:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Creative Matrix: Generate ideas and sketches based on the professor’s journey and what it would look like in one year, five years, and ten years.</li>
                <li>Sketching: Sketch out ideas for how we could improve the professor’s experience in the virtual cleanroom.</li>
                <li>Importance Difficulty Matrix: Evaluate our ideas based on difficulty of implementation vs quality of life impact on a professor.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Visualizing and Evaluating Our Virtual Cleanroom Concepts</h3>
            <p>Now that we had sketches and ideas for how we could improve the professor’s experience in the virtual cleanroom, we needed to expand on them to create better visual concepts. We also needed to evaluate our ideas with a stakeholder and professor.</p>
            <h4>Methods:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sketching: Build on previous ideas to create our ten year plan.</li>
                <li>Storyboarding: Create a story for each stage of our ten year plan to explain our concepts.</li>
                <li>Persona: Create a persona that defines our user’s needs and pain points for our storyboards.</li>
                <li>Evaluation: Evaluate our concepts with a stakeholder and professor to get feedback.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Understanding How Education Adapted to COVID-19</h2>
            <h3>Overall Goal</h3>
            <p>The team needed a better understanding of how education adapted to alternate environments during the pandemic. Through this, we also needed a more specific space to start designing in. </p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In general, online environments lack professor and student interaction.</li>
                <li>The pandemic had a significant negative impact on how pharmacy labs were run.</li>
                <li>Being able to easily learn and use technologies was one of the biggest hurdles for professors.</li>
                <li>A virtual simulation lab can recreate physical spaces for teaching students.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>Touchpoint Inventory Workshop: Understand pathways and potential pain points. </p>
            <p>Literature Review: Obtain a better understanding of issues in our problem space.</p>
            <p>User Interviews: See how professors and students adapted to the pandemic.</p>
            <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
            <p>Touchpoint Inventory Workshop: A workshop where the team determined major channels, stages, and touchpoints in a professor’s journey.</p>
            <p>Literature Review: A literature review consists of finding a problem, reading a combination of scholarly journals, books and articles and then taking the accumulation of information and sorting the information to be best used. </p>
            <h2>What happens when education is forced to adapt to alternate environments?</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>When we asked ourselves this question, we were hoping to kick-start the beginning of our research by having a specific objective to deeply cover. Having an all encompassing question like this lets us see the overall education industry and its pain points, eventually allowing us to later scope down.</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>We used the touchpoint inventory workshop to understand pathways and potential pain points an educator may follow to look into when doing further research. Connecting the dots between channels, stages, and touchpoints guided the understanding of the education sector for the team.  This workshop showed how the variety of channels within a hybrid educational experience can become intertwined with each other. </p>
            <p>For this workshop, we viewed the topic of education from the professor’s perspective. We analyzed what touchpoints arose on a broader scale in the area of education.  The common theme that surfaced within this activity was the interactions between the students and the professors through different mediums.</p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>
                    Visual display of the various pathways a teacher could follow when engaging in the process of teaching- starting from channels to stages to touchpoints. An example is a teacher could use Zoom to communicate with students to assign group work; or they can use zoom to lecture students by having them watch a video recording.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>From this touchpoint inventory workshop, we developed a comprehensive inventory of channels, stages, and touchpoints in a professor’s journey.</p>
            <p>Channels: Email/Secondary Chat, Zoom, In Person, Brightspace, Virtual Workspace</p>
            <p>Stages: Communicating with students, Interacting with students, Lecturing students, Demonstrating lab/studio work</p>
            <p>Touchpoints: Assigning work, Assigning group work, Answering student’s questions, Evaluating students, Mentoring students, Getting to know students, Grading/Feedback/Critique, Presenting a class topic, Watching a video, Teaching how to use lab tools, Using lab tools/equipment</p>
            <h2>How did lab and studio professors adapt to online or hybrid classes?</h2>
            <p>We conducted secondary research within the education sector on how professors of labs and studio classes moved to an online or hybrid setting. We did this through finding and reading online articles and sources. </p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Performing arts is venues are completely shut down, practicing on zoom was the main extent of putting this online </li>
                <li>Professors struggle to adapt to online with miscommunications, learning the platforms, and finding space to work</li>
                <li>Chemistry professors are using various online platforms to conduct virtual experiments</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We felt that focusing on professors teaching labs was a more feasible field to focus on than studios. We further discussed whether to pursue focusing on chemistry labs, pharmacy labs, or nursing labs, and ultimately found that looking into pharmacy labs was a topic we were most interested in focusing on; given that we had a well established pharmacy program here at Purdue University and a diverse group of users to look into. Our sponsors highlighted that if it was possible, to find a space in which we could explore local stakeholders and be hands-on with our users. </p>
            <h2>How did professors of pharmacy labs adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic?</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>Our goal for primary research was to see firsthand how professors of pharmacy labs and students in the pharmacy program adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we wanted to discover what pain points professors experienced as they restructured labs to cater to online or hybrid environments.</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>We conducted a series of interviews with both professors and students of the Purdue Pharmaceutical Program. We had three interviews with professors of various pharmaceutical labs and two interviews with upperclassmen. These interviews were pivotal moments in our research as they led the team to begin to understand the structure and content of the pharmaceutical labs as well as discover the predominant pain points the professors and students encounter when moving to online/hybrid and then even moving back from online to in-person. After discovering these pain points our team could then scope down further to then begin designing a solution.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In the pharmaceutical labs, we discovered that the current student onboarding training system is not very effective as it is just an industry software and does not allow for the flexibility of a professor trying to teach certain modules.</li>
                <li>As a general note, we learned that classes/groups in the program were fairly small to begin with so having to de-densify even further for covid had a significant negative impact on how classes/labs were run.</li>
                <li>The professors seemed to be in agreement that a big issue with moving to hybrid/remote was not necessarily getting the technology to do so but being able to learn how to use technology.</li>
                <li>Professors also mentioned how they would love a way to implement telehealth into their curriculum more.</li>
                <li>Another professor noted that a possible future space he would love to see is more highly interactive simulation labs and experiences to train their students in even more realistic spaces. We learned of the virtual cleanroom through this.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Discovering The Virtual Cleanroom and Mapping Pain Points</h2>
            <h3>Overall Goal</h3>
            <p>After learning about virtual simulation labs, we wanted to go more in depth with a specific simulation lab. We wanted to understand what a virtual cleanroom is and how we could improve it for professors. </p>

            <p>Virtual Cleanroom: A browser based simulation of a physical cleanroom.</p>
            <h2>What is a virtual cleanroom?</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>Understand what a virtual cleanroom is and what it looks like from a professor’s perspective. </p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>Through an interview, Dr. Steve Abel of the pharmacy program introduced us to the virtual cleanroom. He was able to give us all access to practices and tests in the virtual cleanroom, and we used this to get a better understanding of the current system as well as the perspectives professors may have when using this as a teaching tool.</p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is a browser based tool used by Purdue’s pharmacy program that allows students to access and complete assignments from home. </li>
                <li>It simulates the experience of a real life cleanroom, which is a room in which pharmacists make their drugs. </li>
                <li>Inside the cleanroom, there is typically a workstation that includes a hood, which is a singular workstation that is kept sterilized. </li>
                <li>We saw this as a tangible space to further analyze because of its effective creation of hybrid settings.</li>

            <h2>What are the pain points of a professor using the cleanroom?</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>At this point in our process, it was important for us to determine the pain points of a professor using the virtual cleanroom to discover opportunities for improvement. We intended to use these opportunities to help guide our ideation.</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>We created a user journey map based on the journey a professor would take in the virtual cleanroom. This journey map included stages, user actions, touch points, and pain points. The stages we outlined for this user journey were class setup, instruction, assigning tasks, and evaluation/feedback.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There is currently no way for professors to interact with students in the virtual cleanroom.</li>
                <li>For evaluating and giving feedback to students, professors have to transfer data manually to their school’s grading software.</li>
                <li>There is no onboarding process built into the software for professors or students. </li>
                <li>Video demos have to be accessed separately from the virtual cleanroom. </li>
                <li>When a professor receives student grades, they are exported to an excel sheet with no color coding.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Generating Concepts for The Virtual Cleanroom</h2>
            <h3>Overall Goal</h3>
            <p>Now that we had an understanding of our problem space and professor pain points, we wanted to begin generating concepts. Our goal was to use these concepts to put together our 10-year plan for the virtual cleanroom.</p>
            <h3>Insights That Guided Us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Setting up classes to use the virtual cleanroom is time consuming for professors.</li>
                <li>There is little interaction between professors and students in the virtual cleanroom.</li>
                <li>There are little to no feedback channels in the virtual cleanroom.</li>
                <li>Professors have to evaluate all students manually after taking a test in the virtual cleanroom.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>Creative Matrix: Generate ideas and sketches based on the professor’s journey and what it would look like in one year, five years, and ten years.</p>
            <p>Sketching: Sketch out ideas for how we could improve the professor’s experience in the virtual cleanroom.</p>
            <p>Importance Difficulty Matrix: Evaluate our ideas based on difficulty of implementation vs quality of life impact on a professor.</p>
            <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
            <p>Creative Matrix: A grid where each cell represents the intersection of two disparate categories. Typically, columns are categories related to people and rows are categories related to enabling solutions.</p>
            <p>Importance Difficulty Matrix: A 2×2 matrix used for establishing priority of ideas. Importance is on the x-axis and difficulty is on the y-axis.</p>
            <h2>What can we design in the cleanroom space?</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>Generate ideas based on pain points of professors using the virtual cleanroom. Organize our ideas and sketches into a ten year timespan.</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>We put together a creative matrix to generate ideas that improve a professor’s experience in the virtual cleanroom. The columns for the grid were labeled as each stage in the professor’s journey. This included: Setup/Organize Class, Assigning Tasks, Instruction/Feedback, Evaluation. These stages were based on our user journey map. The rows were labeled: Tools, Activities, One Year, Five Year, Ten Year. We labeled the rows in this way so we could ideate around how tools and activities could look in the future.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The most strategic idea was related to professors showing students how to improve in the virtual cleanroom. This was combined with collaboration and seeing students that need help to be in the five year stage of our ten year plan.</li>
                <li>Making a more realistic environment was also strategic, but would take longer to implement than other ideas. We made this the last stage of our ten year plan since it is more imaginative.</li>
                <li>A better way for professors to view results of student test’s in the virtual cleanroom was in the “just do it” category and became part of the one year stage of our ten year plan.</li>
                <li>We took these ideas and built upon them to begin finalizing our ten year plan and create storyboards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Visualizing and Evaluating Our Virtual Cleanroom Concepts</h2>
            <h3>Overall Goal</h3>
            <p>Now that we had sketches and ideas for how we could improve the professor’s experience in the virtual cleanroom, we needed to expand on them to create better visual concepts. We also needed to evaluate our ideas with a stakeholder and professor.</p>
            <h3>Concepts That Guided Us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In ten years, we wanted the virtual cleanroom to mimic real world interactions to improve the professor’s experience.</li>
                <li>We wanted our ten year plan to come in three stages: Year One, Year Five, and Year Ten.</li>
                <li>The most feasible and highest impact ideas are related to improving feedback channels and interaction between professors and students.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>
                Sketching: Build on previous ideas to create our ten year plan.
            </p>
            <p>Storyboarding: Create a story for each stage of our ten year plan to explain our concepts.
            </p>
            <p>Persona: Create a persona that defines our user’s needs and pain points for our storyboards.</p>
            <p>Evaluation: Evaluate our concepts with a stakeholder and professor to get feedback.</p>
            <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
            <p>XR: Extended reality. This includes features that could be both digital and features that can extend into the real world. </p>
            <h2>What does the future of the cleanroom look like?</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>Build upon the ideas from the importance difficulty matrix and put together our ten year plan to increase direct feedback, immersion, and realism, and create a hybrid platform for lab work allowing students to work in class or from home. </p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>After narrowing down our ideas through the importance difficulty matrix, we continued to ideate on our three stage plan. Each stage increases the amount of direct feedback immersion and realism, including features that directly relate to at least one of these three main focus points. </p>
            <p>Stage 1 (Feasible in one year): Improve current feedback channels between the student and professor, focused on the virtual cleanroom space.</p>
            <p>Stage 2 (Feasible in five years): Create more feedback channels and opportunities of student professor interaction.</p>
            <p>Stage 3 (Feasible in ten years): Building more realistic and immersive experiences and fully developing the clean room into a teaching environment.</p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>We were able to develop more ideas related to each stage in our ten year plan. Below are sketches we created for our plan</p>

            <h2>What does the professor in our story look like?</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>We wanted to create a cohesive story to explain our design concepts, but needed to develop a persona to help tell that story.</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>We created our persona to convey the benefits of the immersive clean room through embodied interactions of professors and their students. Our persona was used throughout our storyboards, demonstrating how a hands-on virtual environment could replicate realistic scenarios and professors like him could guide their students through the process and provide a leading learning experience.</p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>We developed a persona, Dr. Robinson, to aid in telling the professor’s story. Everything we outlined for this persona are needs we identified in previous research, based on our user group.</p>

            <h2>What do our concepts look like for a professor?</h2>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Visualize the impacts our concepts may have on the professors of the pharmaceutical program, and visually showcase our concepts in a comprehensive and digestible manner</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>To represent and understand what the suggestions in the concept design package would look like for professors in the Pharmacy  Program, we created storyboards to visualize the implementation.  To showcase the process of each stage (1 year, 5 year, 10 year) and their relative concepts, we incorporated our persona, Dr. Robinson, as a detail to support the framework of our concept package.  The storyboards not only show the process but the expectations and needs of Dr. Robinson, and comparably the Pharmacy Program professors who utilize the clean room.  </p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The future direction of the storyboards and persona created, all depend on what aspects of our concept package in the 3 phases (1 year, 5 year, 10 year) are implemented into the cleanroom and pharmacy program.</li>
                <li>The storyboards can be used as a framework for pharmacy and clean room facilitators to understand what it would look like to plan for and utilize the suggested changes.  </li>
                <li>We discovered throughout the process some key concepts that presented themselves of higher importance for implementation than others.</li>
                <li>It was crucial for us to understand our persona and the pharmacy professors’ instructional needs and preferences.  By doing so, we could better coordinate our concepts so that instructors’ needs were still being met, but adjustments and advancements were still being made.  </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What do our users and stakeholders think of our virtual cleanroom concepts?</h2>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Get feedback from a stakeholder and professor by sharing our design concepts. See if our concepts are valuable and discover any areas we can improve.</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>We conducted two concept evaluations, one with Dr Abel, the founder of the cleanroom specifically focused on our current design package, and the second with a Pharmacy Program professor covering all of our pre-finalized ideation.  While the professor we tested with did not personally use the software, their insights were still very valuable due to their mindset of actually being a professor and having a better base of knowledge on the program.   </p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <h4>Stage 1 (one year)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In our one year plan our testers greatly valued the processes that automated or gave quality of life changes to aspects of teaching like grading, assessments, and integration to current university systems like brightspace.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>On a similar note our testers expressed that they found the reimagining of the lab reports with the color coding and restructuring for easier digestibility to be something they would value and want implemented. </li>
                    <li>One of our testers also raised looking into ADA accessibility standards when working with things of this nature.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Implementing ways to track or have video recording of students for greater understanding of their activity and process was something we did not have in this stage but our testers mentioned that it would be a meaningful addition</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Stage 2 (five years)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Our testers felt that VR implementation would be very feasible at this stage of the cleanroom, this helped to validate many of our ideas in this stage</li>
                <li>The focus on the collaborative theme for this stage seemed to be of great importance to our testers, while they did not know how impactful the increase of peer collaboration would be, they greatly emphasized how valuable collaborative elements between professor and student are.</li>
                <li>Lastly, our testers mentioned wanting an implementation of an undo/rewind feature to the steps in the cleanroom activities. Since at this stage the cleanroom would be a fairly immersive virtual experience having the ability to revert mistakes rather than having to restart a lab after each mistake would be a valued quality of life feature and teaching opportunity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Stage 3 (ten years)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In our second evaluation the professor said they felt VR is already attainable and implementable as the technology currently stands and that the main factor holding back from use is just price. He felt it would be more realistic to expect within ten years to have AR developed to an extent to where it could be implemented into the pharmacy curriculum.</li>
                <li>
                    Overall both testers could identify the value of turning the cleanroom into a much more immersive AR experience. They felt that allowing students even more hands-on access and significantly more realistic and immersive experiences would increase the quality of education students gained from the cleanroom.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>From our evaluations of our final concepts, we have a few next steps. First, we would want to somewhat overhaul our year 10 designs and frame them more in the space of AR and what that would look like. Our team would also like to expand on areas of our Years One and Five plan implementing the feedback we gained and any features and ideas our testers felt were important. Last, after iterating on our design package, the team would want to dive into creating an implementation guide to help illustrate ways to go about implementing these concepts over the next 10 years, what that might look like, what technologies to use and various benefits/disadvantages to each, and how to adapt it to future technologies we may not foresee. </p>
