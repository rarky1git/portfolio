                <p>In this first project, our team created an new activity tracker application which aims to give users a system that reduces fake out methods and promotes healthier behaviors and behavior changes in the users daily life. Fake out methods are any behavior that is an improper exploitation of a system and encourages the user to “cheat” through the system.</p>

                <h2>Contribution</h2>
                <p>Working in pairs for this project, I split many of the tasks with Mason. I completed interviews, ideation (sketches), research, as well as user testing through Zoom. I focused mainly in the areas or research and ideation within this project, working with Mason to iterate on the ideas that came through my ideation.

                <h1>Exercise “Fake Out”</h1>
                <h2>Project Goal
                </h2>
                <h3>10,000 Steps
                </h3>
                <p>Our team chose to focus on users who struggle with a goal focused approach to daily activity by creating an app with a growth focused model. Goals such as reaching 10,000 steps per day or reaching a certain amount of steps per hour can be hard to obtain and difficult to manage during a typical working week, especially for users with a particularly sedentary job, such as computer work or other types of desk work.
                </p>
                <h3>Goal-Oriented Approach</h3>
                <p>By creating a growth based model for a user’s activity, we aim to create healthier approaches to reaching milestones in daily, weekly and overall activity. Using small and large achievement markers to encourage change in the mental model for the user by learning to explore, rather than count data to achieve goal markers.
                </p>
                <h2>Research
                </h2>
                <h3>Secondary Research
                </h3>
                <p>We began our process by searching for data and articles related to fitness trackers and their approach to data display and goal markers. We narrowed in on the concept of the 10,000 step marker, and we found that this marker may not work for everyone, especially for common user groups with health problems and the growing elderly population. Since this marker for information does not work for everyone, we made an observation that a goal based approach may be hindering for users with lower-activity levels due to unavoidable obstacles, such as medical issues. These goals have made it increasingly harder to develop consistency with a truly active lifestyle, rather than one that comes across inaccurately through data. A research firm named Endeavor Partners has indicated that fitness trackers have become easily abandoned, making the claim that an estimated third of trackers are abandoned in the first six months of use (Endeavor Partners, 2017).
                </p>
                <h3>Interviews
                </h3>
                <p>For our primary research subjects, we interviewed four of our potential users through online video conferencing software. After gaining insights to their behavior and mental processes in relation to their personal fitness and their relation to wearable devices, some observations became clear. Step counters and activity reminders don’t account for the wrenches that are thrown into the users goals for their activity. At some points, as mentioned in the interview with user three, they can give you too much confidence in their ability to help you achieve wild or outlandish goals. In this user’s case, losing 30 pounds in one month, which is not only highly unattainable but could be dangerous for an individual’s health. Another subject revealed an important consideration for activity which involved the limits of a user’s activity level throughout the day. Having a sedentary job and hindering health issues make it increasingly difficult to reach standard goals for a healthy person, making it very difficult to feel that it’s possible to maintain a “normal” healthy lifestyle. Links to the media from the interviews can be found attached to the “Interviews w/ Richie” document.

                <h2>Ideation
                </h2>
                <p>These sketches are representative of some of the initial ideas we created for our forest idea:

                <h2>User Testing
                </h2>
                <p>After User Testing, we determined that there were a couple of obvious issues that could be addressed quickly. This includes making sure users can add friends quickly and easily with a more obvious direction to adding friends on top of the list and map views of the Friends section of the app. It also seemed to be confusing where the collectible items might be, and that section of the app may need some rewording and additional items to make it more understandable.
                </p>
                <h2>Iteration
                </h2>
                <p>Using our findings from User Testing, we were able to create some suggestions for improvements to our prototype, adding minor tweaks and changes to the functions of the app. Running out of time to add further change, with more time we would add necessary changes to the interactions that we assessed and see how those changes impacted usability.
                </p>
                <h2>Final Design
                </h2>
                <p>Based on our results, we believe our final design would have a lasting impact on how the user perceives their activity as a place to grow, rather than attempting a set goal and falling short. These sketches represent some of our final design:
