                <h1>Rate Your Lyft</h1>
                <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
                <p>For this project, our goal was to replace the current five-star rating and review systems used by ride-sharing systems with a new system that emphasizes specific feedback and ease of use (Gray, 2021).</p>
                <p>Our team decided to focus on business people using ride-sharing services to get around in unfamiliar cities. Based on our research, both primary and secondary, we found that this is a very common use case for these services. We believe these users offer a unique perspective on the issues with current rating systems used by ride-sharing services.</p>
                <p>Traveling business users are unique in a few key ways relating to this project:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>These users are usually running on a tight schedule, so they don’t want to waste any time.</li>
                    <li>Being unfamiliar with the location, they want to know that they can trust the driver to get them where they need to go in a timely manner.</li>
                    <li>After a long and draining day of working, users don’t have much mental energy to engage in tedious tasks.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Team Members</h3>
                <p>My team members for this project were Natasha Chambers and Aidan McDonnell.</p>
                <h3>Contribution</h3>
                <p>While I worked collaboratively with Natasha and Aidan in most areas of the process, I focused on the areas of interviews and ideation. I interviewed two users which I then used their experiences along with research to guide my ideation process. During my ideation process, I rapidly developed several screens and quick ideas that we discussed and sorted through as a team.</p>
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
                <p>Starting off with very little insights on ride sharing apps, we did a basic evaluation of the 5 star rating system that lyft uses and aspects that could influence the relationship and behaviors between the passengers, drivers, and Lyft as a company. We reviewed a variety of sources from reddit channels, basic web articles, academic research journals, and scholarly articles. </p>
                <p>The current Lyft rating system (5-star) is fundamentally flawed in the sense that because the company expects their drivers to all be the best quality and offer a great experience to their customers, Lyft will deactivate a driver if they get under a 4.6 rating (Lyft, 2021). This 5-star system causes what is called a J-Curve, which increases polarization — most people rating a 1 or 5, and increasing the amount of volatility in rating scores.  
                </p>
                <p>The rating system drives the reputation of the driver and the service by showing users the driver’s ratings and the users input after each ride. Riders rate drivers for their own benefit, as a way of incentivising the driver to create better riding experiences, explained in an article from the Mack Institute for Innovation Management, “By allowing customers to rate the service providers, it makes service providers more motivated to exert extra effort.” (2017) While rating the service provider is beneficial to ensuring a quality user experience, ratings themselves do not provide any anchorable scale that provides a “portable reputation” in the gig-economy because of how each person perceives the numbered rating. (Sipp, 2017) 
                </p>
                <!-- NEED TO SET UP QUOTE style -->
                <p class="hero-quote">It’s human nature to perceive the scale differently from the next person. No matter how the rungs on the rating scale are labeled, people can view them differently.</p>
                <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/disadvantages-using-graphic-rating-scale-evaluating-performance-33292.html">Bye, 2019</a>
                <p>Because ratings are so ambiguous, it is hard to define what makes a 5 star rating different from a 4 star rating, and this answer can vary widely between customers, drivers, and Lyft as a company.</p>
                <p>As we continued into research and beginning interviews, we began to focus on research that directly affects our user group. Digging deeper into the mental models and needs of our user group, we looked at how conference goers interact with ridesharing apps and how companies like lyft and the taxi industry within conference hub-cities interact and co-exist. </p>
                <p>According to Brian Clark and his personal experience with Lyft at the Las Vegas convention center, convenience is very important for the rider (2018). He talks on instances where the designated  Lyft pick up spot is so out of the way that there is a disincentive to using Lyft. He explains because the taxis are unionized, they get to lobby and have more of a standing ground against ride sharing services. Passenger’s typically come to their lyft rides with a certain mental model and state of mind that can negatively influence the drivers rating.</p>
                <p>According to Renée Frojo, the most important aspects of ride sharing services that a conference attendee would look for is if they get “safe, on-demand, and cost-effective rides when they need them” (2016), Reiterating that convenience, and efficiency are two of the most important aspects to people who are repeatedly traveling between hotel, conference venue, restaurants, and the airport.</p>
                <p class="hero-quote">We really wanted them to be able to focus on their pitch instead of worrying about how to get from one venue to the next. They just had to show up.</p>

                <p>Through the limited user-focused experience articles and resources online for our user group specifically, we got a basic idea of  the  environment our user group is in, but we still wanted to know more regarding their personal experiences and what they prioritize, which led us to do more interviews specifically with our user group.</p>
                <p>Looking at both the upsides and shortfalls of current rating systems, we wanted to choose a rating experience that would acknowledge the user groups need for a quick and easy process. </p>

                <!-- set up img captions here -->
                <p>This table illustrates reasons why people choose different rating visualizations. Thumbs up rating visualizations scored the highest in “Easy to read & understand”, making them quick for users.</p>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <!-- caption below -->
                <p>This graph shows evaluations for the mean rating time for different review methods and differing scores.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>We noted that the Thumbs Up rating method was most effective in addressing our user group’s needs for being efficient and easy to understand according to Figure A and it embraces the inflation curve that comes along with the star ratings. Because the rating system only has two choices, the cognitive load is much lower compared to other systems like the 100-point rating system, where the user might have a hard time differentiating what constitutes something as being a 90 compared to a 94. Noting that the thumbs-up method does not inherently represent the user, and is limited in how informative the result can be, we were interested in how we can develop the basic thumbs-up-down system to address its flaws but still keep its benefits.</p>
                <p>Other research collected also included the following insights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emotional Labor is managed by platform companies to control the behavior of their employees (Marquis, 2018).</li>
                    <li>Each user must define and interpret the value of rating for themselves. Sometimes, users need to see the details of rating to convince them, or make them feel validated by their choice (Maharani, 2016).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on this research and insights we collected, we filtered our research into insights and sorted them into the following themes: reasons why people use ride-sharing services (specific to the user group), things to consider for our ideation process, how the current rating system works, and limitations of the current rating system.</p>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <!-- another caption below-->
                <p>This diagram represents collected insights from our secondary research and our Affinity Diagram, which sorts insights into “research-based themes”, to find common insights and important points for the user.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>After compiling our insights into the affinity diagram, we found the following to is most influential to the user group:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Giving the user the ability to provide concise but prioritize the most important feedback</li>
                    <li>Maintaining perceptions of reliability and credibility for the user</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Interviews</h2>
                <p>We first interviewed a 57 year old woman to learn what a typical user would prefer in a ride experience when they aren’t using the service very consistently, and might only have a few rides within a short window of time. We asked about her preferences in a typical ride and what feedback she would give to a driver. (see Appendix B) She uses lyft on vacation and to take trips to Indianapolis in the evening. Through our interview, we found that her main concerns in taking an Lyft are safety, comfort and driver knowledge.</p>
                <p>We then interviewed a 54 year old man, focusing on the experience he encountered while on a work related conference trip. Asking about the same preferences and feedback as our first interview (see Appendix B), we learned that users traveling for big city events more often encounter different problems like traffic, less understanding of the roads, and drop off issues such as being taken to the incorrect entrances or far away from the destination.</p>
                <p>Through this, we found that ratings from users who were in big cities for conferences should be addressed because of the issues they face when riding in an unfamiliar city, including safety, comfort, and navigational challenges.</p>
                <p>After narrowing down our user group based on previous interviews and secondary research, we wanted to learn what our user group prioritized and how their experience with ride-sharing apps are influenced by being in a conference setting and having those specific constraints. (See Appendix B) We asked our two interviewees to describe to us the transportation systems at conferences and instances where they would choose to take a lyft/uber instead of the conference wide shuttles/busses, and the type of aspects they prioritize, to better understand our target users behaviors. </p>
                <p>We then interviewed a 52 year old male who’s an IT executive and has a lot of experience with using ride sharing apps during work travel and conventions. We learned that timing is very important to our user group and they don’t necessarily like waiting around for the shuttle buses that run on a schedule when they just want to go take a break and grab a change of clothes in their hotel room before a long night of dinner meetings. Knowing the city, being able to get around traffic quickly and knowing where to drop him off are also important factors. Interviewee 3 noted, “I only cancel if they can’t find me or the place quickly or if I see them driving around like they’re lost.”, meaning because they want a relatively efficient experience, spending time looking at the driver’s rating on their profile is not what they focus on, rather they care more about how quick and easy the pick-up experience is.  Through interviewee 3 describing his typical drop off experience, he emphasized how he is oftentimes preoccupied by checking emails, getting his stuff together and finding where he needs to be through the crowd of people while he is trying to exit the lyft and rate the driver. Yet he likes to be deliberate when rating, he will almost always fill out the rating later when he has time, using the notification from lyft/uber to rate his driver as a reminder, and never in that moment. </p>
                <p>We interviewed a 44 year old, female, computer science educator who primarily uses ride sharing apps while attending workshops and conferences all over the country and abroad. She differed in how she typically likes to take rides with others whenever possible when she travels. She values good communication with the driver and knowing how to get around the city. Since she on most occasions stays in Airbnbs, having a driver that knows the area will be better able to quickly find her at pick-up and drop her off timely. She tends to be less black-and-while with the rating, and typically finds herself rating every driver with high marks, showing that she values her time and takes the easiest path.</p>

                <!-- img cap -->
                <p>We collected insights from our interviews and created an Affinity Diagram, which sorts insights into “research-based themes”. Insights from our interviews suggested that our users place importance on the following aspects of drivers and the rating experience: efficient experiences (such a pick-up and drop off), low cognitive load, cleanliness, and knowledge of the area they are visiting.</p>
                <p>Interviewees found these common elements most important to their driver & ride:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having a clean car</li>
                    <li>Knowing the city & having good navigational skills</li>
                    <li>Having a safe & relaxing ride</li>
                    <li>Being timely and efficient throughout the process</li>
                    <li>Communicating with the rider</li>
                    <li>Knowing where to pick up and drop off</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>Our first design iteration following our initial two interviews focused on improving the feedback mechanisms of the experience and understanding what makes a good or bad riding experience. We wanted to emphasize allowing the user to provide more detailed and specific feedback to understand the reasoning behind their rating. Our interviewees showed a desire to avoid having to write reviews manually, so we wanted to make sure this specific feedback could be left without the user having to write anything.</p>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <!-- img cap -->
                <hr>
                <p>Our second iteration focused on streamlining the rating process. We wanted to maximize specificity of feedback while minimizing time and mental energy spent by the user. We chose to implement a thumbs up/thumbs down system, as our research showed that this system was the easiest to read and understand (Sparling & Sen, 2011). We also added icons to each feedback item in the hopes that these would allow the user to recognize them more quickly than text alone. Lastly, we retained the option for the user to leave a text review if they would like to, but this is not required.</p>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <!-- img cap -->
                <p>Iteration 2 – These sketches more clearly demonstrate the flow of our design. Users are shown different feedback options depending on whether they choose thumbs up or thumbs down. There is also an optional text review box.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Our third design iteration was created after receiving feedback from peer groups on our second iteration. One thing our peers criticized was the fact that the specific feedback options depended on whether the users chose thumbs up or thumbs down, so we decided to instead allow users to select both their likes and dislikes regardless of which option they initially chose. We also removed the images to allow for more options to be shown on screen. All of this resulted in a design that was somewhat of a hybrid between our previous two iterations.</p>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <!-- img cap -->
                <p>Iteration 3 – These sketches show a more refined experience overall. After choosing thumbs up or thumbs down, the user is presented with a list of the most common specific feedback options. The feedback most commonly given to a driver is shown on the driver’s profile, so the user can get a better idea of what the driver is like.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>After three rounds of ideation based on research, interviews, and group critique, we were left with a solid base to work with. We used these ideas and insights to develop a prototype to be used in usability testing.</p>
                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>Then, we used the prototype to test with three potential users. Our goals for the usability test was to understand how the prototype affects the users feedback to the driver and determine whether the design was efficient and easy for the user. We wanted to understand what feedback options that user was missing and what kinds of overall changes we could make to the quickness of the rating. </p>
                <p>We tested our prototype on the following three participants within the user group: a Participants were asked to rate the user in scenarios typical to the user group, where they encounter different drivers in big cities. (see Appendix C) </p>
                <p>From these tests, we made the following observations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our participants found that the “Remind Me Later” button would be useful in situations where they do not have a capacity to accurately evaluate their driver in the moment.</li>
                    <li>Although we intended the “Remind Me Later” to be used after rating the driver, it was found to also be used when they wanted to do both tasks — rating and reviewing together at a later time. </li>
                    <li>As research suggested, when providing responses, users preferred to select preset options and generally would avoid any optional written feedback.</li>
                    <li>Our participants also found scrolling on the feedback options was unintuitive and was obtrusive to the quick rating experience that is necessary, noting the “below the fold” effect in newspapers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We addressed this scrolling inefficiency by consolidating choices into a non-scrolling screen, to improve the efficiency and simplicity of selection, which is a key feature that is beneficial to our user group.</p>
                <h2>Final Design</h2>
                <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ozk4mGO2lsH3KzwxygmUVpIy73UeF-Wl/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
                <p>Our final design focuses on the problems our testing participants encountered with our user testing prototype and refining the user flow.</p>
                <p>We made sure to represent how the user responses in the rating system would affect the information present within the app and the rating system as a whole by addressing how the information will be used to give specific feedback to the drivers based on key words and phrases used to repeatedly rate them over many passenger reviews. The main reason we separated the positive and negative traits was because of scannability and confusing connotation. We found that computers have a hard time distinguishing between positive and negative reviews by word choice alone. We also decided to remove the numerical rating on the drivers profile, because we learned through interviews that our user group doesn’t pay attention to their rating beforehand, none of them have ever canceled a ride because they didn’t like their rating. Our user group is more concerned with identifying the car and finding the driver during pick-up.</p>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>The user starts off with the screen furthest to the left, here they are asked to rate their overall ride. This is meant to be done in the moment and include a low cognitive load, although there may be cases where the passenger will not rate immediately due to their phone being used for another task or in their pocket as to be sure not to leave it behind, based on our interviews. </p>
                <p>When thumbs-up or thumbs-down is clicked, the corresponding circle will fill in green or red respectfully. After getting to the second screen, rather from the next button or remind me later, the user is able to click on traits that would describe their ride experience. Passengers are able to click as many as suits them, even allowing for an add your own customized trait for when it’s necessary to address issues or positives that can not be described with the given option. Those specific traits provided are based on the important factors our user group prioritises based on our secondary research and interviews. </p>
