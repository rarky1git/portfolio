            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2> 
            <p>As a designer, I believe in building products that are personable, inclusive and consistent. Technology must do all that we ask it to while becoming more and more personable and life-like, responding to us in ways we can expect from each other. This includes creating more realistic simulated experiences that can make the digital world blend in seamlessly. Inclusivity is more important than ever, and our designs should always reflect as many people as they can and hope to build a more inclusive future. Diverse perspectives continue to drive the important work being done today and it must expand in the future to adapt to the increasing amount of diverse perspective. Consistency is key to every design process, and ensuring that users can easy learn and adapt to processes that are clear and straightforward and continue to advance the adaptability of digital products.</p>
